there are 2 main approaches to solving RL problems
- the policy π method: the agents brain
	- its the function that tells us what action to take and give the state we are in. So it defines the agents behaviour at a given time.

	This policy is the function that we want to **learn**. Our goal is to find the optimal policy π*, the policy that maximises expected return when the agent acts according to it. We find this π* **through training.**
